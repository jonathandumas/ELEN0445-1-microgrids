This intervention is composed of two lectures:
* The [first lecture](https://github.com/jonathandumas/ELEN0445-1-microgrids-forecasting/blob/927d1f6caa58b43593f4ef9987de800574798673/pdf/2020-ELEN0445-1-microgrids-forecasting-lesson-1.pdf) presents the forecasting basics.
* The [second lecture](https://github.com/jonathandumas/ELEN0445-1-microgrids-forecasting/blob/927d1f6caa58b43593f4ef9987de800574798673/pdf/2020-ELEN0445-1-microgrids-forecasting-lesson-2.pdf) introduces probabilistic forecasts.
